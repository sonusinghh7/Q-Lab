# Q-Lab(Beta version)
Q-Lab Logic Visualizer

Q-Lab is an interactive **React-based learning application** built to help beginners understand **programming logic step by step** using visual execution and very simple English explanations.

At present, Q-Lab demonstrates the **Reverse Number algorithm** (QBasic-style logic), where users can clearly see how each line of code works and how variables change during execution.

🔮 Future Updates (Planned)

Q-Lab is planned to become a complete logic learning lab.

In future updates, this project will include almost all major logical features, such as:

🔁 Number programs (Palindrome, Factorial, Fibonacci, Prime check)

🧮 Conditional logic visualizers

🔂 Nested loop explanations

📊 Array & String logic

🧠 Dry-run mode for every algorithm

🎓 Beginner to advanced logic concepts

👉 Almost all core programming logic features will be added in upcoming versions.
